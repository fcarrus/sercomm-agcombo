# sercomm-agcombo

A tiny (and totally incomplete, at the moment) Python library for managing a Sercomm AGCombo home router.

Developed as an exercise, an maybe useful for some use case (scripted reboot?)

What works:
* Logging in
* Retrieving status details and overview data
* Rebooting
* Setting up port mapping

What's still missing:
* Everything else
